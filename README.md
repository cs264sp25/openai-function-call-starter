# OpenAI Function Call Example

This demo program uses the OpenAI and AccuWeather APIs to generate responses. It allows you to search for weather information for any location in the world in conversational form.

## OpenAI API

This project uses the OpenAI API. You need to create an account and get an API key to use the API. Consult the [quick start guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) for instructions.

## AccuWeather API

We will be using AccuWeather developer services to obtain weather forecasts. AccuWeather is an American company that offers international weather forecasting services. Go to the [AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/) website and create a free account. Following this, you should register a new application to obtain an API key.

## Run locally

Clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd openai-function-call
npm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add the following content.

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY=...
```

Finally, run the following command to start the frontend development server.

```bash
npm run start
```
